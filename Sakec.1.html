<b>Want to become a Grey head hacker</b>
<i>What:</i> A grey-hat hacker sits between white-hat (ethical) and black-hat (malicious): they often find or exploit vulnerabilities without permission, usually with mixed intentions.<br>

<i>Behavior:</i> Probe systems, disclose flaws (sometimes publicly), may ask for payment or help fix them.</br> <br>

<i>Legality:</i> Often illegal — good intent doesn’t guarantee immunity from prosecution.</br> <br>

<i>Motives:</i> Curiosity, reputation, activism, money, or improving security.</br> <br>
<i>Safer options:</i> Join bug-bounty programs, do contracted penetration testing, or follow responsible-disclosure policies.</br>
